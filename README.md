 **Objectives:**
- To build a system that can guess the name of an object from film or real-time footage. 



##  B. ABSTRACT 

Object detection is the method of detecting real-world object instances in still images or videos, such as a vehicle, bike, TV, flowers, and people. It helps us to recognize, localize, and detect different objects within an image, allowing us to have a greater understanding of the image as a whole. It is widely used in image retrieval, protection, surveillance, and a variety of other applications.

Object detection can be accomplished in a variety of ways:

- Detection of Objects Using Features
- Object Detection SVM Classifications with HOG Features by Viola Jones
- Object Detection Using Deep Learning

## C.  DATASET

In this project, weâ€™ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, weâ€™ll review the dataset weâ€™ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

Iâ€™ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

Weâ€™ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, weâ€™ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
- Detect face masks in real-time video streams

Weâ€™ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our face mask detector.


There is two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector as shown in Figure 2:

![Figure 2](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_phases.png)
Figure 2: Phases and individual steps for building a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision and deep learning 

In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps (as shown by Figure 1 above):

- Training: Here weâ€™ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras/TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk

- Deployment: Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask

Weâ€™ll review each of these phases and associated subsets in detail in the remainder of this tutorial, but in the meantime, letâ€™s take a look at the dataset weâ€™ll be using to train our COVID-19 face mask detector.


Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset as shown in Figure 3:

![Figure 3](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/face_mask_detection_dataset.jpg)

Figure 3: A face mask detection dataset consists of â€œwith maskâ€ and â€œwithout maskâ€ images. 

The dataset weâ€™ll be using here today was created by PyImageSearch reader Prajna Bhandary.

This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:

- with_mask: 690 images
- without_mask: 686 images

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether a person is or is not wearing a mask.

How was our face mask dataset created?
Prajna, like me, has been feeling down and depressed about the state of the world â€” thousands of people are dying each day, and for many of us, there is very little (if anything) we can do.

To help keep her spirits up, Prajna decided to distract herself by applying computer vision and deep learning to solve a real-world problem:

- Best case scenario â€” she could use her project to help others
- Worst case scenario â€” it gave her a much needed mental escape

The dataset/ directory contains the data described in the â€œOur COVID-19 face mask detection datasetâ€ section.

Three image examples/ are provided so that you can test the static image face mask detector.

Weâ€™ll be reviewing three Python scripts in this tutorial:

- train_mask_detector.py: Accepts our input dataset and fine-tunes MobileNetV2 upon it to create our mask_detector.model. A training history plot.png containing accuracy/loss curves is also produced
- detect_mask_image.py: Performs face mask detection in static images
- detect_mask_video.py: Using your webcam, this script applies face mask detection to every frame in the stream

In the next two sections, we will train our face mask detector.



## E   TRAINING THE COVID-19 FACE MASK DETECTION

Figure 4: Figure 10: COVID-19 face mask detector training accuracy/loss curves demonstrate high accuracy and little signs of overfitting on the data

As you can see, we are obtaining ~99% accuracy on our test set.

Looking at Figure 4, we can see there are little signs of overfitting, with the validation loss lower than the training loss. 

Given these results, we are hopeful that our model will generalize well to images outside our training and testing set.


## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

You can then launch the mask detector in real-time video streams using the following command:
- $ python detect_mask_video.py
- [INFO] loading face detector model...
- INFO] loading face mask detector model...

Figure 5: Mask detector in real-time video streams

In Figure 5, you can see that our face mask detector is capable of running in real-time (and is correct in its predictions as well.



## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, you learned how to create a COVID-19 face mask detector using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

To create our face mask detector, we trained a two-class model of people wearing masks and people not wearing masks.

We fine-tuned MobileNetV2 on our mask/no mask dataset and obtained a classifier that is ~99% accurate.

We then took this face mask classifier and applied it to both images and real-time video streams by:

- Detecting faces in images/video
- Extracting each individual face
- Applying our face mask classifier

Our face mask detector is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient, making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, Jetosn, Nano, etc.).
