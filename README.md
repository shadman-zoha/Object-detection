# OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING 

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

**Team Members:** 
- MD SHADMAN ZOHA

 **Objectives:**
- To build a system that can guess the name of an object from film or real-time footage. 



##  B. ABSTRACT 

Object detection is the method of detecting real-world object instances in still images or videos, such as a vehicle, bike, TV, flowers, and people. It helps us to recognize, localize, and detect different objects within an image, allowing us to have a greater understanding of the image as a whole. It is widely used in image retrieval, protection, surveillance, and a variety of other applications.

Object detection can be accomplished in a variety of ways:

- Detection of Objects Using Features
- Object Detection SVM Classifications with HOG Features by Viola Jones
- Object Detection Using Deep Learning

## C.  DATASET

This project is an attempt to demonstrate about how we can use object detector to recognize any object, location of an object in any image and also count the number of instances of an object.
For this project we are going to use COCO dataset, which represents - Common Objects in Context. The COCO dataset provides a base dataset and benchmark for evaluating the periodic improvement of the models through computer vision research. Coco has some other features which are object segmentation, recognition in context, superpixel stuff segmentation, 1.5 million object instances, 80 object categories .  
In object detection for input an image can be taken with one or more pictures such as a picture and for output we will get one or more bounding boxes and a class label for each bounding box.
